# Manufacturing Files

If you'd like to get this design made by a PCB fab you'll need these files.

Most services should accept `gerbers.zip`

For SMT assembly you'll need the BOM and POS files (`Koca.csv` and `Koca-all-pos.csv` respectively). These files use a semicolon delimeter by default, you'll need to change this to a comma for use with JLCPCB.
